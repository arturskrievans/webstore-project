            <h2>Website's Functionality:</h2>
            <p>
                This website supports all CRUD operations via creating accounts and products, displaying their information as well as updating and deleting them. <br><br>
                By uploading a lot of products to the shop (at least 5) you can additionally see pagination in effect to make navigation process easier. Filtering by price and 
                date is also possible. Products that are sold cannot be further modified and are simply marked as "sold" with an eye-catching visual effect. <br><br>
                All the necessary information is stored in the database models such that the users don't have to reupload it on server and session restarts. <br> <br>
                Basic security protocols like password hashing (werkzeug.security), user authentication and link validation are followed. Meaning, no sensitive information is 
                stored in plain text anywhere, you cannot access different accounts or perform unauthorized operations by manipulating the URL parameters. <br><br>
                As you can see by the <b><a href="{{url_for('chat')}}">Global Chat</a></b> page, this website does not only use the HTTP communication protocol, but also 
                takes the advantage of WebSockets - request and receive information with persistent connection. <br> In short, the HTTP protocol is used for all CRUD methods 
                where new data is first received from a form and only then displayed. WebSockets are used for a live global chat room where we don't want the user to have to reload
                the page to see new messages. Nevertheless, the last 50 messages are still saved in the database and rendered on page load so users can view some message history.

            <h2>What Was Used For The Implementation?</h2>
            <p>
                All the backend was implemented using <b>Flask</b> - a lightweight Python web framework.<br><br>
                For database models I used <b>SQLAlchemy</b> - a Python SQL toolkit that supports nearly all SQL based operations. <br><br>
                For fully functional WebSocket implementation and more interactive front-end <b>JavaScript</b> was also applied. <br><br>
                To secure bidirectional communication for the live chat, I additionally used <b>Socket.IO</b> - a Python and JavaScript supported library for real-time web apps.<br><br>
                Libraries like <b>werkzeug, os, uuid</b> were used to make the website more secure and robust. <br><br>
                To structure, display and style the content <b>HTML + css</b> were also utilized.
